# Step 1: Detect Tools and Determine Tier

## STEP GOAL:

Verify availability of the three forge tools (ast-grep, gh, qmd), read any existing configuration for re-run comparison, check for tier override, and calculate the capability tier.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step, ensure entire file is read
- 🎯 Execute all operations autonomously — no user interaction

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are a system executor performing environment resolution
- ✅ Tool detection must be empirical — run actual commands, never assume
- ✅ Record exact results (version strings, error messages)

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on tool detection and tier calculation
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to write any files — that is step-02's job
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip any tool check — all 3 must be verified
- 💬 Tool command failures are NOT errors — they indicate unavailability

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the MANDATORY SEQUENCE exactly
- 💾 Store all results in memory for step-02
- 📖 Load tier-rules.md for calculation reference
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to proceed without checking all 3 tools

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- This is the first step — no prior context exists
- Available: forge-tier.yaml and preferences.yaml may exist from prior runs
- Focus: tool verification and tier calculation only
- Dependencies: none — this step bootstraps everything

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

### 1. Load Tier Rules

Load and read {tierRulesData} for the tool detection commands and tier calculation logic.

### 2. Check for Existing Configuration (Re-run Detection)

**Read existing forge-tier.yaml** at `{project-root}/_bmad/_memory/forger-sidecar/forge-tier.yaml`:
- If exists: store the current `tier` value as `{previous_tier}` and `tier_detected_at` as `{previous_detection_date}`
- If not found: set `{previous_tier}` to null (first run)

**Read existing preferences.yaml** at `{project-root}/_bmad/_memory/forger-sidecar/preferences.yaml`:
- If exists: check for `tier_override` value
- If not found: set `{tier_override}` to null

### 3. Verify Tool: ast-grep

Run: `ast-grep --version`

- If succeeds: record `{ast_grep: true}` and store version string
- If fails (command not found or error): record `{ast_grep: false}`

### 4. Verify Tool: gh

Run: `gh --version`

- If succeeds: record `{gh_cli: true}` and store version string
- If fails: record `{gh_cli: false}`

### 5. Verify Tool: qmd

Run: `qmd status`

- If succeeds and indicates operational: record `{qmd: true}`
- If fails or indicates not initialized: record `{qmd: false}`

### 6. Check Optional: Security Scan (SNYK_TOKEN)

Check if the `SNYK_TOKEN` environment variable is set:

- If `SNYK_TOKEN` is non-empty: record `{security_scan: true}`
- If `SNYK_TOKEN` is empty or unset: record `{security_scan: false}`

This is informational only — security scan availability does NOT affect the tier level. It is recorded in forge-tier.yaml so that create-skill's validation step can report actionable guidance when security scanning is unavailable.

### 7. Calculate Tier

**If `{tier_override}` is set and valid (Quick, Forge, or Deep):**
- Use `{tier_override}` as `{calculated_tier}`
- Note that override is active for the report step

**If no override, apply tier rules from {tierRulesData}:**
- `{ast_grep}` AND `{gh_cli}` AND `{qmd}` all true → **Deep**
- `{ast_grep}` true (regardless of gh/qmd) → **Forge**
- Otherwise → **Quick**

**If `{tier_override}` is set but invalid:** ignore it, use detected tier, flag for warning in report.

### 8. Auto-Proceed

"**Proceeding to write configuration...**"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- After tier calculation is complete, immediately load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- This is an auto-proceed step with no user choices
- Proceed directly to next step after detection and calculation

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN all 3 core tools have been verified, optional security scan checked, and the tier calculated will you load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute the configuration write step.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- All 3 tools checked via verification commands (not existence checks)
- Existing forge-tier.yaml read for re-run comparison (if present)
- Existing preferences.yaml read for tier_override (if present)
- Tier correctly calculated from tool results or override applied
- All results stored in context for step-02
- Auto-proceeded to step-02

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Skipping any tool verification
- Using `which` or `command -v` instead of verification commands
- Assuming tool availability without running the command
- Writing files in this step (that is step-02)
- Not checking for existing configuration on re-runs

**Master Rule:** Every tool MUST be verified empirically. No assumptions, no shortcuts.
