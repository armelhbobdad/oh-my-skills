# Unit Detection Heuristics

## Purpose

Rules for identifying discrete skillable units within a project. A "skillable unit" is a self-contained component with clear boundaries that can be documented as an independent skill.

## Detection Signals

### Strong Signals (High Confidence)

| Signal | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Independent package.json / Cargo.toml / go.mod | Unit has its own dependency manifest | `packages/auth/package.json` |
| Separate entry point | Unit has a main/index file | `services/api/src/index.ts` |
| Docker/service definition | Unit runs as an independent service | `docker-compose.yml` service entry |
| Distinct export surface | Unit exports a public API consumed by others | `src/lib/index.ts` with re-exports |
| Workspace member | Listed in root workspace configuration | `pnpm-workspace.yaml` packages |

### Moderate Signals (Medium Confidence)

| Signal | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Directory depth boundary | Top-level directory with self-contained structure | `src/modules/payments/` |
| Naming convention | Follows organizational naming pattern | `@org/package-name` |
| Separate test suite | Has its own test directory or config | `packages/auth/__tests__/` |
| README.md presence | Has documentation at directory level | `libs/utils/README.md` |
| CI/CD pipeline reference | Referenced in build/deploy configuration | `.github/workflows/deploy-auth.yml` |

### Weak Signals (Low Confidence — Require Corroboration)

| Signal | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Large directory | Many files in a subtree | 50+ files under one directory |
| Comment boundaries | Code comments marking sections | `// --- Auth Module ---` |
| Import clustering | Files that import primarily from each other | Tight import graph cluster |

## Boundary Classification

### Service Boundary
- Independent deployable unit
- Own process, port, or container
- Clear network interface (REST, gRPC, message queue)
- Scope type: `full-library`

### Package Boundary
- Workspace member or independently versioned package
- Own dependency manifest
- Exports consumed by other packages
- Scope type: `full-library` or `specific-modules`

### Module Boundary
- Logical grouping within a single package
- Shared namespace or directory structure
- Internal cohesion, external coupling through defined interface
- Scope type: `specific-modules` or `public-api`

### Library Boundary
- Third-party dependency with significant project-specific usage patterns
- Custom wrappers, configurations, or integration code
- Scope type: `public-api`

## Disqualification Rules

Do NOT recommend as a skillable unit if:

1. **Too small**: Fewer than 3 source files or 100 lines of code
2. **Generated code**: Auto-generated files (protobuf, GraphQL codegen, etc.)
3. **Pure configuration**: Only config files with no logic
4. **Test-only**: Test utilities with no production code
5. **Vendor/dependency**: Third-party code copied into project
6. **Already skilled**: Existing skill found in forge_data_folder (recommend update-skill instead)

## Stack Skill Candidate Detection

Flag units as stack skill candidates when:

1. **Co-import frequency**: Two or more units are imported together in 3+ files
2. **Integration adapter**: A unit exists primarily to bridge two other units
3. **Shared state**: Multiple units read/write to the same data store
4. **Orchestration layer**: A unit coordinates calls across multiple other units

## Tier-Aware Scanning Depth

| Forge Tier | Scanning Approach |
|------------|-------------------|
| Quick | File structure analysis: directory trees, manifest files, entry points, naming conventions |
| Forge | AST analysis: export surfaces, import graphs, dependency trees, type hierarchies |
| Deep | AST + QMD: temporal evolution, refactoring patterns, semantic relationships, architectural drift |
