All files under 200-line recommended limit. No files exceed 250-line maximum.
All 8 step files present with sequential numbering, no gaps.
Data files present. No templates needed (non-document workflow).

## Frontmatter Validation: ✅ PASS (after fix)

| File | Variables | Status | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| step-01 | nextStepFile, forgeTierFile, preferencesFile | ✅ PASS | Fixed: removed unused extractionPatternsData, added preferencesFile |
| step-02 | nextStepFile | ✅ PASS | |
| step-03 | nextStepFile, extractionPatternsData | ✅ PASS | |
| step-04 | nextStepFile | ✅ PASS | |
| step-05 | nextStepFile, skillSectionsData | ✅ PASS | |
| step-06 | nextStepFile | ✅ PASS | |
| step-07 | nextStepFile | ✅ PASS | |
| step-08 | (none — final step) | ✅ PASS | Correctly has no nextStepFile |

**Fixes Applied:**
- Removed unused `extractionPatternsData` from step-01 frontmatter
- Added `preferencesFile` to step-01 frontmatter (was hardcoded in body)
- Updated step-01 body to reference `{preferencesFile}` variable

No forbidden patterns detected. All paths use correct relative format.

---

## Critical Path Violations: ✅ PASS (2 acceptable notes)

### Config Variables Identified
- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`

### Dead Links: ✅ PASS
All frontmatter file references resolve to existing files. Step chain is complete.

### Module Awareness: ✅ PASS
No BMB-specific paths in SKF module workflow. Correctly uses `{project-root}/_bmad/skf/` paths.

### Content Path Notes (Acceptable)
- step-01 line 73: `{project-root}/forge-data/{skill-name}/skill-brief.yaml` — Dynamic path with runtime variable `{skill-name}`, acceptable as instructional content
- step-07 line 56: `{project-root}/` prefix for output directories — Dynamic paths for runtime artifact generation, acceptable for prescriptive action workflow

These use `{project-root}` (a BMAD standard variable) combined with runtime data. Not violations for prescriptive workflows.

---

## Menu Handling Validation: ✅ PASS

| Step | Menu Type | Compliance |
|------|-----------|------------|
| step-01 | Auto-proceed (P3) | ✅ No menu, no A/P — correct for init |
| step-02 | Conditional gate | ✅ Menu only if match found, auto-proceed if not |
| step-03 | C-only (P2) — Gate 2 | ✅ Handler + execution rules + redisplay present |
| step-04 | Auto-proceed (P3) | ✅ No menu — correct for conditional skip |
| step-05 | Auto-proceed (P3) | ✅ No menu — correct for assembly |
| step-06 | Auto-proceed (P3) | ✅ No menu — correct for validation |
| step-07 | Auto-proceed (P3) | ✅ No menu — correct for file writing |
| step-08 | Final (none) | ✅ No menu, no nextStepFile — correct for final |

All menu-bearing steps (02, 03) include "halt and wait" instructions.

---

## Step Type Validation: ✅ PASS

All 8 steps have correct structural elements for their assigned types:
- Init with Input Discovery, 6 auto-proceed middles (1 conditional gate, 1 confirmation gate), 1 final
- No mismatched step types detected

---

## Output Format Validation: ✅ PASS

Non-document workflow compliance:
- No `outputFile` in frontmatter (except step-07 which writes files at runtime)
- No template references (non-document)
- No `stepsCompleted` tracking in output
- Content stays in context until step-07 materializes

---

## Instruction Style Check: ✅ PASS

- Prescriptive style throughout (exact tool commands, specific operations)
- No facilitator language ("shall we", "what do you think")
- Zero hallucination enforcement in extraction (step-03) and compilation (step-05)
- Confidence tier labeling referenced consistently (T1, T1-low, T2)
- Role framing: "skill compilation engine" (not "facilitator")

---

## Collaborative Experience Check: ✅ PASS

Autonomous compilation pipeline design:
- No "NEVER generate content without user input" in autonomous steps (correct)
- Only 2 user interaction points: Gate 1 (step-02 conditional), Gate 2 (step-03 confirmation)
- All other steps auto-proceed after task completion

---

## Subprocess Optimization Opportunities: N/A

Linear pipeline with tool-delegated heavy lifting. No high-priority subprocess opportunities identified per design. Low-priority batch parallelization noted in plan.

---

## Cohesive Review: ✅ PASS

- Data flows logically: brief → ecosystem → extraction → enrichment → compilation → validation → generation → report
- No contradictions between steps
- Tier-dependent behavior consistent across all 8 steps (Quick/Forge/Deep)
- Error handling consistent: graceful degradation everywhere except file write failures (which correctly halt)
- Provenance citation format consistent (`[AST:{file}:L{line}]`, `[SRC:{file}:L{line}]`, `[QMD:{collection}:{doc}]`)
- Overall narrative is a clear compilation pipeline

---

## Plan Quality Validation: ✅ PASS

- Plan file tracks all build steps completed
- Conversion coverage verified: 8/8 original steps, all inputs/outputs, all instructions
- 7 improvements beyond original spec documented
- Status: CONFIRMED with full coverage

## Summary

**Overall Validation Status: ✅ PASS**

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| File Structure & Size | ✅ PASS |
| Frontmatter Validation | ✅ PASS (after fix) |
| Critical Path Violations | ✅ PASS |
| Menu Handling | ✅ PASS |
| Step Type Validation | ✅ PASS |
| Output Format | ✅ PASS |
| Instruction Style | ✅ PASS |
| Collaborative Experience | ✅ PASS |
| Cohesive Review | ✅ PASS |
| Plan Quality | ✅ PASS |

**Fixes Applied During Validation:**
1. Removed unused `extractionPatternsData` from step-01 frontmatter
2. Added `preferencesFile` variable to step-01 frontmatter
3. Updated step-01 body to use `{preferencesFile}` instead of hardcoded path

**Notes (Non-Blocking):**
- 2 dynamic `{project-root}` paths in body content acceptable for prescriptive action workflow
- step-05 at 198 lines (near 200-line recommended limit) — acceptable, no action needed
