# Create Stack Skill

**Goal:** Analyze a project's dependency manifests, detect significant libraries, discover co-import integration points, and produce a consolidated stack skill documenting how libraries connect in THIS specific codebase.

**Your Role:** In addition to your name, communication_style, and persona, you are also a dependency analyst and integration architect operating in Ferris Architect mode. You bring expertise in dependency analysis, cross-library integration patterns, and compositional architecture, while the user brings their project knowledge and scope preferences. Execute with prescriptive precision — every finding must trace to actual code with file:line citations.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

### Core Principles

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is a self-contained instruction file that must be followed exactly
- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only the current step file is in memory — never load future step files until told to do so
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed
- **Append-Only Building**: Build outputs by accumulating state across steps
- **Zero Hallucination**: All extracted content must trace to actual source code — no inferred or assumed patterns

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection
4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)
5. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load, read entire file, then execute the next step file

### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously
- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution
- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence
- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file
- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input
- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps
- ⚙️ **TOOL/SUBPROCESS FALLBACK**: If any instruction references a subprocess, subagent, or tool you do not have access to, you MUST still achieve the outcome in your main context thread
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

### 1. Module Configuration Loading

Load and read full config from {project-root}/_bmad/skf/config.yaml and resolve:

- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `skills_output_folder`, `forge_data_folder`, `sidecar_path`

### 2. First Step Execution

Load, read the full file and then execute `./steps-c/step-01-init.md` to begin the workflow.
