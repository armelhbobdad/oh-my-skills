# Step 3: Rank and Confirm Scope

## STEP GOAL:

Count import frequency for each dependency across the codebase, rank by usage, and present for user confirmation of which libraries to include in the stack skill.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- ⚙️ TOOL/SUBPROCESS FALLBACK: If any instruction references a subprocess, subagent, or tool you do not have access to, you MUST still achieve the outcome in your main context thread
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are a dependency analyst operating in Ferris Architect mode
- ✅ Prescriptive precision — import counts must reflect actual code
- ✅ User has final authority on scope — present data, let them decide

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on counting imports, ranking, and getting user confirmation
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to extract library documentation — that is step 04
- 💬 Present data clearly so user can make informed scope decisions
- 🎯 Use subprocess (Pattern 1 grep) for import counting when available

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Count imports per library across the codebase
- 💾 Store confirmed_dependencies as workflow state
- 📖 Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to proceed without explicit user scope confirmation

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- From step 02: raw_dependencies[] with ecosystem info
- This step produces: confirmed_dependencies[] (user-approved scope)
- User interaction: Gate 1 — scope confirmation required
- Apply scope_overrides from step 01 if provided

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

### 1. Count Import Frequency

For each dependency in `raw_dependencies`:

**Launch a subprocess** that runs grep across all source files in the project to count import statements for each library. Return only the counts, not file contents.

Use ecosystem-appropriate import patterns:
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `import .* from ['"]library`, `require\(['"]library`
- Python: `import library`, `from library import`
- Rust: `use library::`, `extern crate library`
- Go: `"library"` in import blocks
- (Match patterns from manifest-patterns.md)

**Subprocess returns:** `{library_name: import_count, files: [file_paths]}` for each dependency.

**If subprocess unavailable:** Perform grep operations in main thread sequentially.

Exclude from counting:
- Test files (*/test/*, *_test.*, *.spec.*, *.test.*)
- Config files (*.config.*, .eslintrc, etc.)
- Build artifacts (dist/, build/, node_modules/, target/, __pycache__/)

### 2. Rank and Filter

Sort dependencies by import count (descending).

Apply filtering:
- **Include by default:** Libraries with 2+ import files
- **Flag as trivial:** Libraries with 0-1 import files
- **Apply scope_overrides** from step 01 if provided (force include/exclude)

### 3. Present Ranked List

"**Dependency ranking complete.** Here are your project's libraries ranked by usage:

| # | Library | Imports | Files | Category |
|---|---------|---------|-------|----------|
| 1 | {name} | {count} | {file_count} | runtime |
| 2 | {name} | {count} | {file_count} | runtime |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Below threshold** (0-1 imports — excluded by default):
| Library | Imports | Category |
|---------|---------|----------|
| {name} | {count} | {category} |

**Total:** {total} dependencies detected, {above_threshold} recommended for inclusion

---

**Please confirm your scope:**
- Type **C** to accept the recommended scope (all above-threshold libraries)
- Type library names to **add** from the below-threshold list
- Type **-library_name** to **exclude** a recommended library
- Type a custom list to override entirely"

### 4. Process User Response

**If C (accept recommended):**
Store all above-threshold libraries as `confirmed_dependencies`.

**If modifications requested:**
Apply additions/exclusions, display updated list, and ask for final confirmation.

**If custom list provided:**
Use the custom list as `confirmed_dependencies`.

Display final confirmation:

"**Scope confirmed:** {count} libraries selected for stack skill extraction.

{List confirmed libraries}

**Proceeding to parallel extraction...**"

### 5. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: **Select:** [C] Continue to Extraction

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting scope
- ONLY proceed to next step when user confirms scope and selects 'C'

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Store confirmed_dependencies, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other: Process as scope modification, redisplay updated list, then [Redisplay Menu Options](#5-present-menu-options)

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Import counts reflect actual codebase usage (not guesses)
- Dependencies ranked by import frequency
- Trivial dependencies filtered below threshold
- User explicitly confirmed scope
- confirmed_dependencies stored for step 04

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Fabricating import counts without grepping
- Proceeding without user scope confirmation
- Including test/config files in import counts
- Starting library extraction (step 04's job)

**Master Rule:** Present data, let user decide. No extraction until scope is confirmed.
