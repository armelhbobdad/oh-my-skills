# Step 5: Detect Integrations

## STEP GOAL:

Analyze co-import patterns between confirmed libraries to identify integration points — where and how libraries connect in this specific codebase.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- ⚙️ TOOL/SUBPROCESS FALLBACK: If any instruction references a subprocess, subagent, or tool you do not have access to, you MUST still achieve the outcome in your main context thread
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are an integration architect operating in Ferris Architect mode
- ✅ Zero hallucination — only document integrations evidenced in actual code
- ✅ Every integration pattern must cite co-import files with file:line references

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on detecting cross-library patterns using Pattern 1 (grep) subprocess
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to compile SKILL.md — that is step 06
- 💬 Integration detection is the core differentiator of stack skills vs individual skills
- ⚙️ If subprocess unavailable, perform grep operations in main thread

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Load integration-patterns.md for detection rules
- 💾 Store integration_graph as workflow state
- 📖 Auto-proceed to step 06 after detection complete
- 🚫 Graceful handling if no integrations detected

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- From step 03: confirmed_dependencies[] with file lists per library
- From step 04: per_library_extractions[] with exports and patterns
- This step produces: integration_graph {pairs[], types[], files[]}
- This is the VALUE-ADD step — what makes stack skills different from individual skills

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

### 1. Generate Library Pairs

From `confirmed_dependencies`, generate all unique pairs:
- N libraries → N*(N-1)/2 pairs
- Skip pairs where either library had extraction failure in step 04

Report: "**Analyzing {pair_count} library pairs for integration patterns...**"

### 2. Detect Co-Import Files

For each library pair (A, B):

**Launch a subprocess** that greps across all source files to find files importing BOTH library A and library B. Return only file paths and import line numbers.

**Subprocess returns:** `{pair: [A, B], co_import_files: [{path, line_A, line_B}], count: N}`

**If subprocess unavailable:** Intersect the file lists from step 03 import counts for each pair.

**Threshold:** A pair must have 2+ co-import files to qualify as an integration pattern (single file co-imports may be incidental).

### 3. Classify Integration Types

Load `{integrationPatterns}` for classification rules.

For each qualifying pair (2+ co-import files), analyze the co-import files to classify the integration type:

- **Type 1: Middleware Chain** — Sequential function calls piping output between libraries
- **Type 2: Shared Types** — Type definitions exchanged between libraries
- **Type 3: Configuration Bridge** — One library configuring or initializing another
- **Type 4: Event Handler** — Event patterns crossing library boundaries
- **Type 5: Adapter/Wrapper** — Thin wrapper connecting library interfaces
- **Type 6: State Sharing** — Shared state stores or context providers

For each detected integration:
- Identify the top 3 files demonstrating the pattern
- Extract a brief description of how the libraries connect
- Assign confidence: T1 if AST-verified, T1-low if source reading

### 4. Build Integration Graph

Assemble the integration graph:
- **Nodes:** Confirmed libraries (with extraction data from step 04)
- **Edges:** Detected integration pairs with type, file count, and description
- Identify **hub libraries** (connected to 3+ other libraries)
- Identify **cross-cutting patterns** (patterns spanning 3+ libraries)

### 5. Display Integration Summary

**If integrations detected:**

"**Integration detection complete.**

**Integration graph:** {lib_count} libraries, {pair_count} integration pairs

**Hub libraries** (connected to 3+ others):
{For each hub:} - **{library}** — integrates with {partner_list}

**Detected integrations:**
| Library A | Library B | Type | Co-import Files | Confidence |
|-----------|-----------|------|-----------------|------------|
| {name} | {name} | {type} | {count} | {tier} |

{If cross-cutting patterns:}
**Cross-cutting patterns:**
- {description spanning 3+ libraries}

**Proceeding to stack compilation...**"

**If no integrations detected:**

"**No co-import integration patterns detected** between confirmed libraries.

The libraries in this project appear to operate independently. The stack skill will contain library summaries without an integration layer.

**Proceeding to stack compilation...**"

### 6. Auto-Proceed to Next Step

Load, read the full file and then execute `{nextStepFile}`.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- All library pairs analyzed for co-imports
- Integration types classified using pattern rules
- Hub libraries and cross-cutting patterns identified
- Integration graph built with confidence labels
- Graceful handling of zero integrations (not a failure)
- Auto-proceeded to step 06

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Fabricating integrations not evidenced in code
- Not applying the 2+ file threshold for pairs
- Starting to compile SKILL.md (step 06's job)
- Treating zero integrations as a workflow failure (it's valid)

**Master Rule:** Only document integrations that exist in actual code. Zero integrations is a valid result.
