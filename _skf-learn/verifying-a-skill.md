title: Verifying a Skill
description: How to audit any SKF-compiled skill — walk every instruction back to an upstream commit and line number in under 60 seconds.
---

**Nothing is made up.** Every instruction in every skill traces back to a specific file, a specific line, and a specific commit in the upstream source. If a skill claims a function exists, you can open the real source tree at the pinned commit and see it with your own eyes. If the claim and the source disagree — that's a bug, and SKF treats it as one.

---

## The three-step audit

Pick any symbol in any SKF-compiled skill. You can trace it to the exact line of upstream source in under 60 seconds.

### 1. Open the skill's `metadata.json`

Every skill ships a `metadata.json` next to its `SKILL.md`. Note two fields:

- `source_commit` — the exact commit SHA the skill was compiled from
- `source_repo` — the upstream repository

This is the anchor. Everything else traces back to this commit.

### 2. Open the skill's `provenance-map.json`

Provenance maps live in `forge-data/{skill}/{version}/provenance-map.json` alongside each compiled skill. Find your symbol. Every entry carries its own `source_file` and `source_line`:

```json
{
  "export_name": "search",
  "export_type": "function",
  "params": ["query_text: str", "query_type: SearchType = GRAPH_COMPLETION", "top_k: int = 10"],
  "return_type": "List[SearchResult]",
  "source_file": "cognee/api/v1/search/search.py",
  "source_line": 27,
  "confidence": "T1",
  "extraction_method": "ast-grep"
}
```

The snippet above is a real entry from [`forge-data/oms-cognee/0.5.8/provenance-map.json`](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills/blob/main/forge-data/oms-cognee/0.5.8/provenance-map.json). Line number is not rounded. Confidence tier is explicit. Extraction method is named. Nothing is paraphrased.

### 3. Visit the upstream repo at the pinned commit

Open `{source_repo}` at `{source_commit}`, jump to `{source_file}` line `{source_line}`. The signature in `SKILL.md` should match what you see in the source.

If it doesn't, **that's a bug**. [Open an issue](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/bmad-module-skill-forge/issues/new/choose). SKF will republish the skill with a new commit SHA and a new provenance map. Falsifiability isn't a feature — it's the whole deal.

### Workflow-time enforcement

The same anchor is enforced automatically by `skf-test-skill` and by gap-driven `skf-update-skill`. Before either workflow reads source at a recorded `source_line`, it runs `git rev-parse HEAD` on the local workspace and compares it to `metadata.source_commit`. If the workspace has drifted, the workflow halts with a `halted-for-workspace-drift` status and tells you the exact `git checkout {source_ref}` to re-sync — so spot-checks can never silently verify against the wrong tree. Pass `--allow-workspace-drift` to opt in to reading the current HEAD anyway; the override is recorded in the final report rather than hidden.

## Where to look for what

Every file in the per-skill output carries a specific job. Here's the lookup table for the really skeptical:

| Question | File |
|---|---|
| What commit was the source pinned to? | `skills/{name}/{version}/{name}/metadata.json` → `source_commit` |
| Which symbols are documented and where did each come from? | `forge-data/{name}/{version}/provenance-map.json` |
| What AST patterns were used for extraction? | `forge-data/{name}/{version}/extraction-rules.yaml` |
| What signatures, types, and examples did the extractor actually capture? | `forge-data/{name}/{version}/evidence-report.md` |
| How was the skill scored? Show me the math. | `forge-data/{name}/{version}/test-report-{name}.md` |
| How was the skill scoped, and what was deliberately left out? | `forge-data/{name}/skill-brief.yaml` |

Everything a reader needs to reconstruct the compilation is in the two sibling directories: `skills/` ships to consumers, `forge-data/` is the audit trail.

## The scores, including the ones we lose

Completeness scoring is never 100%. The [scoring formula](../how-it-works/#completeness-scoring) is deterministic and the pass threshold is **80%** — but every test report also logs the specific edges where a skill falls short, so the numbers aren't marketing.

Take oh-my-skills' four reference skills as an example. Their scores range from **99.0% to 99.49%** — none are perfect, and every test report names the specific drift it found:

| Skill | Score | What the report discloses |
|---|---|---|
| [oms-cocoindex](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills/blob/main/forge-data/oms-cocoindex/0.3.37/test-report-oms-cocoindex.md) | **99.0%** | 114/114 provenance entries; 55 public-API denominator from `__init__.py` `__all__`; 20/20 sampled signatures matched. Two denominators (barrel vs. full surface) both disclosed with rationale. |
| [oms-cognee](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills/blob/main/forge-data/oms-cognee/0.5.8/test-report-oms-cognee.md) | **99.45%** | 25/25 exports documented; denominator pinned to `cognee/__init__.py` lines 18–47. |
| [oms-storybook-react-vite](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills/blob/main/forge-data/oms-storybook-react-vite/10.3.5/test-report-oms-storybook-react-vite.md) | **99.49%** | 215/216 documented — the missing 1 entry is logged openly as **GAP-004**, a canonical surface count drift from the stated denominator. |
| [oms-uitripled](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills/blob/main/forge-data/oms-uitripled/0.1.0/test-report-oms-uitripled.md) | **99.45%** | 34-entry denominator (not 11, not 25) with the full reconciliation reasoning in the report. |

A promise of perfection is suspicious. A promise of visible fallibility is trustworthy. SKF writes down the edges it can't score cleanly — so you can read them and decide for yourself whether the remaining coverage is enough for your use case.

### GAP-004: a worked example of the 1% that fails

The [`oms-storybook-react-vite` test report](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills/blob/main/forge-data/oms-storybook-react-vite/10.3.5/test-report-oms-storybook-react-vite.md) scores **215/216** — not 216/216. The missing 1 entry is logged as **GAP-004**: a canonical export surface count (via the provenance map) diverges from the stated denominator in metadata.json. The report names the gap, shows the math, and leaves the drift visible for the next recompilation pass. Nothing was hidden.

That's the pattern SKF asks you to trust: when scoring can't reach 100%, the report says so, cites the line, and leaves a fingerprint for the next audit.

## Build-time drift detection (for docs themselves)

The SKF docs you're reading right now are themselves verified against oh-my-skills. A `docs/_data/pinned.yaml` anchor file records the exact version, commit SHA, and confidence tier of every reference skill. A Node validator (`tools/validate-docs-drift.js`) runs as part of `npm run quality` and:

1. **Confirms canonical truth** — every anchor in `pinned.yaml` is cross-checked against the actual `metadata.json` in oh-my-skills. Version, commit, tier, and authority must match.
2. **Scans docs for stale prose** — every `.md` file is grepped for `<library> v?<x.y.z>` patterns and any version that disagrees with `pinned.yaml` is flagged with file + line number.

If the validator flags drift, the CI fails before the docs get merged. It's the same "nothing is made up" contract SKF applies to skills, applied to the docs that describe SKF. When the anchor file is updated to reflect a new oh-my-skills release, the prose must update too — otherwise `npm run docs:validate-drift` blocks the merge.

You can run it yourself from the SKF repo root:

```bash
npm run docs:validate-drift
```

Or point it at a different local copy of oh-my-skills:

```bash
OMS=/path/to/your/oh-my-skills npm run docs:validate-drift
```

Clean output looks like this:

```
OK: 4 skills checked against /home/you/oh-my-skills, no drift.
```

Dirty output cites exact file:line locations so the fix is mechanical.

## Reference output: oh-my-skills

Every example in this page points at [**oh-my-skills**](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills), the SKF reference portfolio. Four Deep-tier skills (cocoindex, cognee, Storybook v10, uitripled), each shipping its full audit trail alongside the compiled skill. Both the worked example for this page and the continuing proof that the pipeline does what it says. If you want to see what SKF produces when you run it on real libraries, that's the answer.
