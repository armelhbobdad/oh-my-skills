# Concepts

This page defines the key terms you'll encounter in Skill Forge, with concrete examples.

---

## Agent Skills

An agent skill is an instruction file that tells an AI agent how to use your code. Instead of the agent guessing your API from its training data, it reads the skill and gets real function names, real parameter types, and real usage patterns.

Skills follow the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard, so they work across Claude, Cursor, Copilot, and other AI tools.

**Example:** A skill for [cognee](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills) tells your agent: "The function is `cognee.search()`, it takes `query_text`, `query_type`, `top_k`, and `session_id`, and it's defined at `cognee/api/v1/search/search.py:L26`." Every parameter and location is AST-verified from the actual source code.

---

## Provenance

Provenance means every instruction in a skill traces back to where it came from. For code, that's a file and line number. For documentation, it's a URL. For developer discourse, it's an issue or PR reference. If SKF can't point to a source, it doesn't include the instruction.

**Examples** (from a [real generated skill](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills)):
- `[AST:cognee/api/v1/search/search.py:L26]` — extracted from source code via AST parsing (T1)
- `[SRC:cognee/api/v1/session/__init__.py:L8]` — read from source code without AST verification (T1-low)
- `[QMD:cognee-temporal:issues.md]` — surfaced from indexed developer discourse (T2)
- `[EXT:docs.cognee.ai/getting-started/quickstart]` — sourced from external documentation (T3)

---

## Confidence Tiers (T1/T1-low/T2/T3)

Each piece of information in a skill carries a confidence level based on where it came from:

- **T1 — AST extraction:** Pulled directly from source code via AST parsing. This is structural truth — the function signature actually exists in the code right now. Cited as `[AST:file:Lnn]`.
- **T1-low — Source reading:** Found by reading source files directly without AST parsing. The location is correct but the type signature may be inferred. Produced by Quick tier and by Forge/Forge+/Deep when ast-grep cannot parse a specific file. Cited as `[SRC:file:Lnn]`.
- **T2 — Evidence (Deep tier only):** Surfaced by QMD knowledge search from issues, PRs, changelogs, or documentation within the repository. Available only when QMD is installed (Deep tier). Reliable context, but not as definitive as code. Cited as `[QMD:collection:document]`. T2 has two temporal subtypes:
  - **T2-past** — Historical context (closed issues, merged PRs, changelogs) explaining API design decisions. Surfaces in the skill's `references/` directory.
  - **T2-future** — Forward-looking context (open PRs, deprecation warnings, RFCs) about upcoming changes. Surfaces in SKILL.md Section 4b (Migration & Deprecation Warnings) and `references/`.
- **T3 — External:** Pulled from external documentation or websites. Treated with caution and clearly marked. Cited as `[EXT:url]`.

Forge+ semantic discovery (via cocoindex-code) does not introduce a new confidence tier — it influences *which* files are extracted, not *how* they're cited. Discovered files are verified by ast-grep (T1) or source reading (T1-low).

See the [Provenance](#provenance) examples above for real citations at each tier.

---

## Capability Tiers (Quick/Forge/Forge+/Deep)

Your capability tier depends on which tools you have installed. Each tier builds on the previous one:

- **Quick** — No tools required. SKF reads source files and builds best-effort skills. Works in under a minute. GitHub CLI used when available.
- **Forge** — Adds [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io). SKF uses AST parsing for structural truth. Instructions are verified against the actual code structure.
- **Forge+** — Adds [cocoindex-code](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex-code). SKF uses semantic code search to discover relevant source regions before AST extraction, improving coverage on large codebases.
- **Deep** — Full pipeline: requires [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io) + [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) + [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) (all three). SKF indexes knowledge for semantic search and performs GitHub repository exploration. Skills get enriched with historical context, deprecation warnings, and cross-reference intelligence. CCC (cocoindex-code) enhances Deep tier when installed — ast-grep + gh + qmd + ccc gives maximum capability.

You don't need all tools to start. SKF detects what you have and sets your tier automatically. See [How It Works](../how-it-works/) for the full technical treatment.

---

## Drift

Drift happens when the source code changes but the skill instructions haven't been updated to match. A skill might still reference a function that was renamed, removed, or had its signature changed.

SKF detects drift by comparing the skill's recorded provenance against the current code. The `audit-skill` workflow (`@Ferris AS`) scans for these mismatches — for both individual skills and stack skills. Stack skills track per-library provenance and, in compose-mode, constituent freshness via metadata hash comparison.

**Example:** Your skill says `createUser(name: string)` but the function was renamed to `registerUser(name: string, email: string)` in the last release. That's drift. For stack skills, constituent drift occurs when an individual skill is updated but the stack hasn't been re-composed to reflect the changes.

---

## Completeness Score

The completeness score is a weighted measure of how thoroughly a skill documents its target. The Test Skill workflow (`@Ferris TS`) calculates it across five categories: **Export Coverage** (are all source exports documented?), **Signature Accuracy** (do documented signatures match the actual code?), **Type Coverage** (are referenced types complete?), **Coherence** (do cross-references and integration patterns resolve?), and **External Validation** (do skill-check and tessl confirm quality?).

The default pass threshold is **80%**, overridable by specifying a custom threshold when invoking `@Ferris TS`. Skills that pass are ready for export (`@Ferris EX`); skills that fail route to update (`@Ferris US`) with a gap report showing what to fix.

**Example:** A skill scores 92% export coverage, 85% signature accuracy, 100% type coverage, 80% coherence, and 78% external validation. With the default weights (36/22/14/18/10), the weighted total is 88.0% — a pass.

Your forge tier determines which categories are scored. Quick-tier skills skip signature accuracy and type coverage (no AST available), and the weights redistribute proportionally. See [How It Works](../how-it-works/#completeness-scoring) for the full formula and tier adjustments.

---

## Version Pinning

Every skill records the exact version (or commit) of the source code it was built from. This means you always know which version of the library the instructions apply to.

By default, the version is auto-detected from the source (package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.). You can also target a specific version — either by specifying it during `@Ferris BS` (brief-skill) or by appending `@version` to a quick skill command (`@Ferris QS cognee@0.5.0`). This is especially useful for docs-only skills where no source code is available for auto-detection. When targeting a specific version on a remote repository, SKF resolves the matching git tag and clones from it — so the extracted API signatures actually reflect the target version's code, not just the label applied to whatever happens to be on the default branch.

When the source updates, you can re-run `@Ferris US` (update-skill) to regenerate the skill for the new version while preserving any manual additions you've made.

---

## Skill Management

Two workflows let you rename and retire skills without manually editing files:

**Rename (`@Ferris RS`)** — Change a skill's name across all its versions. Transactional: copies to the new name, verifies every reference, then deletes the old name only after verification succeeds. If anything fails mid-rename, the old skill stays intact. Use it to graduate quick-skills to formal names, or to add a suffix like `-community`.

**Drop (`@Ferris DS`)** — Retire a specific version (e.g., drop `cognee 0.1.0` because it's deprecated) or an entire skill. Two modes:
- **Soft drop (default)** marks the version as deprecated in the manifest and keeps files on disk. It stops appearing in CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/.cursorrules immediately but is reversible by editing the manifest.
- **Hard drop (purge)** also deletes the files from disk. Irreversible.

Both operations automatically rebuild platform context files so your AI agents see the updated state on the next session.

## BMAD Module

SKF is a plugin (called a "module") for [BMad Method](https://docs.bmad-method.org/), a framework for running structured AI workflows. You don't need to know BMad to use SKF — the standalone installer sets everything up.

→ If you already use BMAD, see [BMAD Synergy](../bmad-synergy/) for how SKF workflows pair with BMM phases and optional modules like TEA, BMB, and GDS.

---

## Ferris

Ferris is the AI agent persona that runs all SKF workflows. When you type `@Ferris CS`, you're telling Ferris to run the create-skill workflow.

Ferris switches between five modes depending on which workflow is active: Architect (exploring and building), Surgeon (precise updates), Audit (quality checks), Delivery (packaging for distribution), and Management (renaming and dropping skill versions).

---

## Zero Hallucination

SKF's core principle: if an instruction can't be traced back to actual source code, it doesn't get included in the skill. This is the opposite of how most AI tools work — they generate plausible-sounding content from training data. SKF only includes what it can verify.

This doesn't mean skills are perfect. Quick-tier skills read source files without AST verification, so they rely on best-effort extraction. But even Quick skills cite their sources, and no tier includes invented information.

---

## Scripts & Assets

Skills can include executable scripts and static assets alongside the main SKILL.md instructions. Scripts handle deterministic operations (validation, setup, data processing) while assets provide templates, schemas, and configuration examples. Both are extracted from the source repository with provenance tracking — SKF copies them, it doesn't fabricate them.

**Example:** A database library skill might include `scripts/migrate.sh` (copied from the library's `bin/` directory) and `assets/config-schema.json` (copied from the library's `schemas/` directory). Each file carries a `[SRC:file:L1]` citation and SHA-256 hash for drift detection.

---

## Session Context

Each SKF workflow should run in a clean conversation session. Workflows load step files, knowledge fragments, and extraction data into the LLM's context as they execute. If you run a second workflow in the same session, leftover context from the first workflow can interfere with the second — causing stale references, mode confusion, or degraded output quality.

**Best practice:** Clear your session context (start a new conversation) before invoking a new workflow. For example, after `@Ferris CS` completes a skill, start a fresh session before running `@Ferris TS` to test it.

This applies to sequential workflows in the same session. Sidecar state (forge tier, preferences) persists across sessions automatically — you don't lose any configuration by clearing context.

---

## Full Control Over Scope

You can compile multiple skills from the same target (repo or docs) with different scopes, intents, and audiences. Each brief defines what to extract and why, producing a distinct skill from the same source.

**Example:** From a single library like [cognee](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee), you could compile:

- `cognee-core` — public API surface for general usage
- `cognee-graph-types` — type system and data model for schema work
- `cognee-migration` — upgrade patterns and breaking changes for version transitions

Each skill serves a different use case. You decide the scope — SKF compiles exactly what you specify.

---

## Best Practices

SKF integrates skill authoring best practices from the Claude platform and community guidelines. Generated skills use third-person descriptions for reliable agent discovery, consistent terminology throughout, and appropriate degrees of freedom (prescriptive for fragile operations like database migrations, flexible for creative tasks like code reviews). These practices are enforced during compilation and verified during testing.

**Example:** A skill description reads "Processes payments via REST API with token-based auth. NOT for: billing dashboards" — third-person voice, specific keywords, and negative triggers help agents select the right skill.

**Operational best practices:**

- **One workflow per session** — clear context between workflows to prevent stale state from affecting results
- **Multiple skills per target** — compile different skills from the same repo or docs for different use cases and audiences
- **Progressive capability** — start with Quick mode, upgrade tiers as you install more tools
