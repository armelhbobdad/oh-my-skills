# Step 6: Write Output

## STEP GOAL:

To write the compiled SKILL.md, context-snippet.md, and metadata.json to the skills output folder and display a completion summary with next step recommendations.

## Rules

- Write exactly what was compiled — do not modify content
- If any write fails, hard halt with error details
- Path resolution: Quick-skill uses `{repo_name}` as the skill name and defaults `{version}` to `1.0.0` if not detected from the extraction inventory

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.

### 1. Create Output Directory

Resolve `{version}` from the extraction inventory's detected version, defaulting to `1.0.0` if not detected. Create the skill output directories:

```
{skill_group}                          # {skills_output_folder}/{repo_name}/
{skill_package}                        # {skills_output_folder}/{repo_name}/{version}/{repo_name}/
```

If `{skill_package}` already exists, confirm with user before overwriting:

"**Directory `{skill_package}` already exists.** Overwrite existing files? [Y/N]"

- **If user selects Y:** Proceed to section 2.
- **If user selects N:** Halt with: "Overwrite cancelled. Existing skill preserved. Run [QS] with a different skill name or remove the existing directory manually."

### 2. Write SKILL.md

Write the compiled SKILL.md content to:

```
{skill_package}/SKILL.md
```

Confirm: "Written: SKILL.md"

### 3. Write context-snippet.md

Write the context snippet to:

```
{skill_package}/context-snippet.md
```

Confirm: "Written: context-snippet.md"

### 4. Write metadata.json

Write the metadata JSON to:

```
{skill_package}/metadata.json
```

Confirm: "Written: metadata.json"

### 4b. Create Active Symlink

Create or update the `active` symlink at `{skill_group}/active` pointing to `{version}`:

```
{skill_group}/active -> {version}
```

If the symlink already exists, remove it first and recreate.

Confirm: "Symlink: {skill_group}/active -> {version}"

### 5. Handle Write Failures

**If any file write fails — HARD HALT:**

"**Write failed:** Could not write to `{file_path}`.

Error: {error details}

Please check:
- Does the output directory exist and is it writable?
- Is there sufficient disk space?
- Are there permission issues?"

### 6. Display Completion Summary

"**Quick Skill complete.**

**Skill:** {repo_name} v{version}
**Language:** {language}
**Source:** {resolved_url}
**Authority:** community
**Confidence:** {extraction confidence}

**Files written:**
- `{skill_package}/SKILL.md`
- `{skill_package}/context-snippet.md`
- `{skill_package}/metadata.json`
- `{skill_group}/active` -> `{version}`

**Exports documented:** {count}
**Validation:** {pass / N issues (advisory)}

---

**Recommended next steps:**

1. **test-skill** (advisory) — Run cognitive completeness verification on the generated skill
2. **export-skill** — Package and distribute the skill with platform-aware context injection

**Note:** This is a best-effort community skill. For deeper analysis with AST-verified exports and provenance tracking, use the full **create-skill** workflow with a skill brief."

### Result Contract

Write the result contract per `shared/references/output-contract-schema.md`: the per-run record at `{skill_package}/quick-skill-result-{YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}.json` (UTC timestamp, resolution to seconds) and a copy at `{skill_package}/quick-skill-result-latest.json` (stable path for pipeline consumers — copy, not symlink). Include `SKILL.md`, `context-snippet.md`, and `metadata.json` paths in `outputs` and export count in `summary`.

### 7. Chain to Health Check

ONLY WHEN the skill files are written and the completion summary has been displayed will you then load, read the full file, and execute `{nextStepFile}`. The health-check step is the true terminal step — do not stop here even though the summary reads as final.
